This repository is the _code dump_ of my game Nevergrid.

Back when Swift was announced I was really excited to have a go at the language and decided to pick up a simple game project to learn the basics, thus was born this project.

## NOTES

- You need XCode 7.1+ with Swift 2+ to compile this
- SpriteKit is the engine of choice. You are expected to have an intermediate level of experience with SpriteKit and Swift in general. There are no tutorials / write-ups linked to this project at the moment.
- This codebase has spanned the evolution of Swift all the way from v1.0 to v2.x. If you want my honest opinion, there are many many things I would re-write today in a very different way, cleaning up a lot of mess
- This was my first (somewhat) serious attempt at gamedev - which means there were a lot of things I did not know (in general gamedev sense) - and it would show in some places in the code. While I have tried my best to incorporate the good stuff like events, an entity component system et cetera, from an architectural standpoint, I feel there are bits and pieces that I would have approached quite differently today. Nonetheless, this should provide enough mental stimulation if you do a code read through :)
- I have replaced the music file with silence (I bought the original music and do not want to share it)
- I use Fabric.io for analytics in the App Store version. The analytics bit has been stripped off from this branch of the code
- It lacks comments somewhat; although I do write readable code. Always. I think. (Sigh)
- This repo is meant to be a read-only reference. That means no Issues / Pull Requests.
